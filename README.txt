This SQL/Python based based project was created by Dana Cavanagh & Connor George. 

Our goal was to create a functional recipe database that allowed users a wider range of search criteria. For example, excluding/including allergens, cuisines, cook time, etc. . 
To put our database to the test, we utilised a Python sql-connector to create a simple text-based proof of concept.

There are also some rudamentary unit tests used in the development of our database. 
As of August 2024, this project is permanently at an end. On to bigger, better and less buggy things! : )
