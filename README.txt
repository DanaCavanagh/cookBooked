This SQL/Python based based project was created by Dana Cavanagh & Connor George as a third semester (sophmore year) project. 

Our goal was to create a functional recipe database that allowed users a wider range of search criteria. For example, excluding/including allergens, cuisines, cook time, etc. . 
To put our database to the test, we utilised a Python sql-connector to create a simple text-based proof of concept.
There are also some rudimentary unit tests used in the development of our database. 

This is the first iteration of this project's lifecycle. The front-end connector is inefficient and imperfect in many places.
Due to a need to focus on our studies, we left this project in January 2023.

Maybe someday we will revisit this project for future iterations. But for now: On to bigger, better and less buggy things! : )
